# C Programming Language Book Example and Exercse Codes

This is a codes repo for C Programming Language by K&R.

## How the codes are structured

- Chapter1 to Chapter4: use sections to order the code files.
- From Chapter5 to end: use pages(not book page, but pdf page number) to order the codes.

## Run Codes in Linux

Compiler and Run one specific code that specified in CMakeLists.txt,

```shell
./scripts/llaunch.sh
```

Compiler only,

```shell
./scripts/lcompile.sh
```

If you have already compiled, then you can run it directly,

```shell
./scripts/lrun.sh
```

## Run Codes in Window

**Notice:** not thoroughly tested in Windows, so if you encounter some problems, feel free to open an issue in this Repo.

Similar to Linux, use the following scripts,

```powershell
.\scripts\llaunch.ps1
```

```powershell
.\scripts\lcompile.ps1
```

```powershell
.\scripts\lrun.ps1
```
